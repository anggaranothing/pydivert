class WinDivertAddress(ctypes.Structure):
    """
    Ctypes Structure for WINDIVERT_ADDRESS.
    The WINDIVERT_ADDRESS structure represents the "address" of a captured or injected packet.
    The address includes the packet's network interfaces and the packet direction.

    typedef struct
    {
        INT64  Timestamp;
        UINT32 IfIdx;
        UINT32 SubIfIdx;
        UINT8  Direction:1;
        UINT8  Loopback:1;
        UINT8  Impostor:1;
        UINT8  PseudoIPChecksum:1;
        UINT8  PseudoTCPChecksum:1;
        UINT8  PseudoUDPChecksum:1;
    } WINDIVERT_ADDRESS, *PWINDIVERT_ADDRESS;

    Fields:

        - Timestamp: A timestamp indicating when WinDivert first captured the packet.
        - IfIdx: The interface index on which the packet arrived (for inbound packets),
          or is to be sent (for outbound packets).
        - SubIfIdx: The sub-interface index for IfIdx.
        - Direction: The packet's direction. The possible values are
                    - WINDIVERT_DIRECTION_OUTBOUND with value 0 for outbound packets.
                    - WINDIVERT_DIRECTION_INBOUND with value 1 for inbound packets.
        - Loopback: Set to 1 for loopback packets, 0 otherwise
        - Impostor: Set to 1 for impostor packets, 0 otherwise.
        - PseudoIPChecksum: Set to 1 for packets with a pseudo IPv4 checksum, 0 otherwise.
        - PseudoTCPChecksum: Set to 1 for packets with a pseudo TCP checksum, 0 otherwise.
        - PseudoTCPChecksum: Set to 1 for packets with a pseudo UDP checksum, 0 otherwise.
