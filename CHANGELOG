Version 2.2.0-anggaranothing
    - Bundle WinDivert 1.4.3.
    - Add a new `pydivert.consts.Flag.DEBUG` flag that causes `pydivert.WinDivert.send()` to
      block until the packet exits the Windows TCP/IP stack.  This is slower
      but provides better error messages, so is useful for debugging.
    - `pydivert.windivert_dll.structs.WinDivertAddress` now includes a Timestamp field
      that indicates when the packet was first captured by WinDivert.
      The timestamp uses the same clock as QueryPerformanceCounter().
    - `pydivert.windivert_dll.structs.WinDivertAddress` now includes a Loopback field
      that indicates whether the packet is a loopback packet or not.
    - `pydivert.windivert_dll.structs.WinDivertAddress` now includes an Impostor field
      which indicates that the packet originated from another driver
      rather than from the network or TCP/IP stack.
    - `pydivert.windivert_dll.structs.WinDivertAddress` now
      includes three new flags relating to checksums:
      * PseudoIPChecksum
      * PseudoTCPChecksum
      * PseudoUDPChecksum
      When set, these flags indicate that the corresponding packet uses
      "pseudo" IP/TCP/UDP checksums instead of the default full checksums.
      Pseudo checksums are cheaper to calculate, and can be used
      when the network hardware supports checksum offloading.
